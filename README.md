## Simple-Card From Figma to code

This is my practice on creating the card starting with HTML and then styling it with CSS

The design is coded again pixel to pixel based on Figma design, you can see life result [here](https://amminn.github.io/Simple-Card/).

And in the end watching how the instructore do it in [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).
